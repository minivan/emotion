# Emotion

Emotion takes Ruby to a whole new level by extending the language with keywords that allow for more expressive code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'emotion'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emotion

## Usage

### Ever see a dirty hack? Emotions got you covered. The days of writing useless comments are long gone.

```ruby
  10.times do
    "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE".ohcrap.itsatrap!.downcase.yey
  end.lolwut

  haha = 3.14.ohgodwhy.to_s + "dary".wat

  haha.gooby.pls
```

That's a lot clearer, isn't it?
